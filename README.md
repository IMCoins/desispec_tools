# Stage project

This repository contains the work I've been doing at the LPNHE (Laboratoire de Physique Nucleaire et des Hautes-Energies) on a 6 months period.
The stage is separated between two complete different work.

## DESI

"Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument"

Quoting the DESI documentation : "DESI, the first Stage IV dark energy experiment,  will use the redshifts of 25 million galaxies to probe the nature of dark energy and test General Relativity"

This repository contains my work on the Python library used to interpret data sent by DESI scope.

## Inventory

This simple project is to rewrite the Inventory-code of the in2p3 service at LPNHE which is completely buggy.
The languages used here is some Php + MySQL.
